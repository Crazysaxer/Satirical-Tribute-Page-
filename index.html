  <h4 class="space-top">Information About These Beloved Squirrels</h4>
<p>UMD Squirrels have a history. A history of greatness that is as worthy of admiration as our beloved testudo. They watch over us in times of need, like little guardian squirrel angels. Throughout every major event in UMD's history, from the 1912 campus fire to the cancelation of our favorite bus routes, they have been there with us. <p>
